## Usage

### Listener

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nocerainfosec/SextouBackdoor.git
   cd SextouBackdoor
   ```

2. Run the listener script:

   ```bash
   python listener.py
   ```

3. Follow the on-screen instructions and enter your educational use oath.

4. The listener will wait for incoming connections from the client.

### Client

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nocerainfosec/SextouBackdoor.git
   cd SextouBackdoor
   ```

2. Edit the `client.py` script to set the appropriate `host` and `port` values to match the listener's IP address and port. Change the following line in `client.py`:

   ```python
   host = "127.0.0.1"
   ```

   Replace `"127.0.0.1"` with the IP address of the machine running the listener.

3. Run the client script:

   ```bash
   python client.py
   ```

4. The client will establish a connection with the listener. You can now input commands on the listener's side to be executed on the client's machine.

## Creating Standalone Executables with PyInstaller

You can create standalone executables for different operating systems using PyInstaller:

- **Windows:**

   Open a Command Prompt and navigate to the directory where your `listener.py` and `client.py` scripts are located.

   ```bash
   pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole listener.py
   pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole client.py
   ```

- **macOS:**

   Open the Terminal and navigate to the directory where your `listener.py` and `client.py` scripts are located.

   ```bash
   pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole listener.py
   pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole client.py
   ```

- **Linux:**

   Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where your `listener.py` and `client.py` scripts are located.

   ```bash
   pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole listener.py
   pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole client.py
   ```

The standalone executables will be generated in the `dist` directory within the project folder.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyInstaller (for creating standalone executables)
